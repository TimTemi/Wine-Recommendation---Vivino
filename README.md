## Project: Wine Recommendation System

Developed a robust data collection and cleaning pipeline, integrating data from multiple sources like Vivino, Bevmo, Delectable, and Wine-Searcher.

### Key Achievements

- Ensured data integrity and consistency by addressing missing values and standardizing formats.
- Conducted extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover insights into customer behavior, preferences, and market trends.
- Utilized visualization techniques (seaborn, plotly) to present key findings to stakeholders.
- Implemented machine learning models, including a recommendation system using Nearest Neighbors algorithm and similarity-based recommendations.
- Fine-tuned models for optimal performance and relevance to user preferences.
- Demonstrated the impact of the new recommendation system on customer satisfaction and business outcomes.
